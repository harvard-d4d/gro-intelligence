From the \xef\xac\x81 rst week onwards,  scattered solitarious and gregarious adults, at  densities up to 15,000 adults/ha, laid eggs throughout  this area, including a few wadis at the foot of the  escarpment near Naro (1626N/3840) where laying  had occurred earlier and \xef\xac\x81 rst to third instar solitarious  hoppers were already present near crops.

Small-scale breeding is expected to extend to most  coastal areas between Massawa and Karora with  hatching occurring throughout the forecast period.

S'\x80\xa2 SITUATION During September, there were several uncon\xef\xac\x81 rmed   reports of swarms on the plateau north of Gebiley  (0941N/4337E) and Hargeisa (0931N/4402E) at  the end of the second week. An immature swarm of  about 80-100 locusts/tree was reported about 500  km to the east near Iskushuban (1017N/5014E)  on the 16th. During the following week, immature  and mature solitarious and gregarious adults were  scattered throughout the plateau between Boroma   \x0c(0956N/4313E) and Erigavo (1040N/4720E), and  hoppers were seen in one area. Some of these adults  may have been leftover from the earlier swarms. On  the 23rd, an immature swarm was seen \xef\xac\x82 ying from  the north at high altitude in the afternoon at Hargeisa  where it settled nearby and covered about 4 km2 with  a density of 45 adults/m2.

S'\x80\xa2 SITUATION During September, more laying occurred in the   interior in Wadi Hadhramaut at the beginning of the  month and near Bayhan (1452N/4545E) towards  the end. Solitarious, transiens and gregarious  hopper infestations and mature adult groups were  present near Ataq (1435N/4649E) and Shabwah  (1522N/4700E). Groups of mature adults were   also present between Al Abr (1608N/4714E) and  Minwakh (1650N/4812E), and in W.

During  the second week, \xef\xac\x81 shermen near Aden saw large  numbers of dead immature gregarious adults off  the coast and washed up on shore, indicating that  some swarms were crossing the sea. Egg laying was  reported on the plains west of Aden on the 20th. By  the end of the month, infestations had declined in the  interior. Control operations treated 230 ha from 1-26  September.  On the Red Sea coastal plains, hatching   commenced in several places between Bayt Al Faqih  (1430N/4317E) and the Saudi Arabian border near  Midi (1619N/4248E) and scattered solitarious hoppers  and adults were present. By the end of the month,  hoppers had formed very small low-density bands  near Suq Abs (1600N/4312E) and groups at densities  of 4-25 hoppers/m2 south of Hodeidah.
