(S'\x80\xa2 SITUATION During July, egg laying and hatching continued   within a large portion of the interior. The most  signi\xef\xac\x81 cant infestations were in remote wadis in the  plateau north of W. Hadhramaut between Al Abr  (1608N/4714E) and Thamud (1717N/4955E) where  hoppers formed groups and bands at densities up  to 400 hoppers/m2. Smaller infestations continued  east to the Oman border at Shehan (1746N/5229E)  and south to Hat (1719N/5205E). Hatching and band  formation also occurred in wadis in the plateau south  of W. Hadhramaut, in crops of W. Hadhramaut itself,  and in the traditional breeding areas in Shabwah near  Ataq (1435N/4649E) and Bayhan (1452N/4545E).  Groups of solitarious and transiens immature and  mature adults were scattered throughout most of  these areas. Although hopper development was  not well synchronized, most hoppers had reached  fourth or \xef\xac\x81 fth instar by the end of the month and were  \xef\xac\x82 edging and forming groups of immature adults. From  the 26th onwards, a few small immature swarms of up  to 3 km2 in size were reported near W. Hadhramaut.   \x0cGround control operations commenced on 4 July and  18,591 ha were treated during July.  Solitarious and transiens hoppers and adults were   present on the desert plains about 100 km west of  Al Abr, and mature solitarious adults were seen at  a few places in the Al-Jawf region near Al Hazm  (1609N/4447E).
