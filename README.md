# Gro Intelligence SIP Project

Locust plague prediction based on time series and historical data

# Machine Learning:

## Basics, essentials, things we will almost definitely use:

[Backpropogation](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/)

[Data Science Course](https://github.com/amarallab/Introduction-to-Python-Programming-and-Data-Science)

## Extra Papers that may be cool to think about:

[Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Networks](colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

[Convolutional Neural Net Overview](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)

# Locust Detection:

[Desert Locust Location Report](http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html)

[Features to Start out With](http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/common/ecg/190/en/1996_EPPO_Cressman_Forecasting.pdf)

# Gro Website:

[Gro!](https://www.gro-intelligence.com/)

# What we want for deliverables:

- Visualization of past locust plagues or predicted locust plagues

- Algorithm or model that predicts locust plagues

- Paper about how to predict locust plagues

- Blog post explaining methods
